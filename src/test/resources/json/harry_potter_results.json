Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

        "description": "Broken Wand: Or How J.K. Rowling Killed Harry Potter is a detailed critique by Timothy A. Wolf of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book in Rowling's acclaimed series, and how he believes she disregarded everything she wrote in her previous novels. For Harry Potter fans, Broken Wand is must-have reading! Using the actual texts, the author finds issues with Rowling's continuity. Like the Trace Charm that would have made it impossible for the teenage Voldemort to get away with killing his Muggle relatives. Or the idea of Harry carrying a piece of Voldemort's soul inside him from the start, when the Dark Lord couldn't even touch him for the first four books. Or \"wandlore,\" which has no consistency to it at all. Citing plot elements like: questioning Harry's account of the murder in the previous book, the Ministry taking over Hogwarts, Snape's Pensieve memories, and Dumbledore explaining his mistakes; Broken Wand maintains that Rowling's Deathly Hallows is essentially just a bad copy of the fifth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Wolf also contends that Dumbledore, Snape, Lily Potter, and Voldemort are completely out of character, and Harry merely repeats the same emotional journey he went through before. Plus, there are many questions and plots left unresolved. About the Author: Timothy A. Wolf spent two years researching and writing Broken Wand. As a science fiction reader his entire life and an adult fan of the Harry Potter novels, he wanted to bring the problems he found with the final book to light. He lives in Franklin, Wisconsin.

        "description": "Harry Potter has captivated the imagination of millions of children. And Harry Potter has caused controversy in churches and schools. What's a parent to do with the magical, mystical world of Harry and his friends? Gina Burkart chose to read the books with her own children. As they read together, she discovered many parallels between Christian faith and the themes of these books. Indeed, the escapades of Harry Potter sparked significant conversation between Burkart and her kids. In this helpful, entertaining guide, Burkart shows how Harry Potter fits into the tradition of fairy tale writing and how this type of literature aids in building a moral framework. She highlights specific situations and emotions from Harry's world that children face in their own life, such as fear, anger, bullies, diversity and the choice of good over evil. Instead of magic words or easy answers, Burkart offers solid, practical advice for helping parents and children navigate Harry Potter's world--and our own--together.",
