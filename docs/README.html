    <body><h1><a href="#overview" name="overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>Bastion is a library that eases the development of end-to-end tests for HTTP APIs. A typical user would write tests using Bastion based off of some sort of API specification. This API specification can be anything like a WADL file, RAML file or a JSON schema. A test engineer would prepare requests and responses based on these specifications to test the overall process of calling these APIs.</p>
<h1><a href="#usage" name="usage"></a>Usage</h1>
<h2><a href="#test" name="test"></a>Test</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Simple Get Request: [ex:general-get-example]</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Simple Post Request: [ex:general-post-example]</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Simple JSON Assertion: (property order in response does not affect test) [ex:simple-json-assertion]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#dependency" name="dependency"></a>Dependency</h2>
<p>Use a dependency management tool such as Maven to download the Bastion library for use in your project. Add the following dependency to your POM file:</p>

    &lt;artifactId&gt;bastion&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;[VERSION]&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
